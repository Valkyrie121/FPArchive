# Chrome Extention got "Taken Down"
Google hates the idea of clearly displaying what they want...

They approved the extension and then banned it for not having a privacy policy, even though it doesn't require permissions that handle sensitive data. Weird thing is their TOS does not require me to make one... 

I am working with a google rep to get this restored. In the meantime you can still side load it 

Just goto chrome://extensions/ and check the box for Developer mode in the top right.
click "Load Unpacked" then select the folder where you placed FPArchive
